# Nepali Date Status Bar

A small app to show nepali date in the MacOS status bar.

Everything required is within the app, no internet required.
Date should work till 2099 Bikram Samvat.

As the script checks for changes in system time every 60 seconds, the date will update within a minute of midnight and not exactly at midnight.

Package the python code to an app, or use the package.

If you like the app and want it to autostart, copy the .plist file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents.
